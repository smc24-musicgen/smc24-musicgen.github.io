### Tools and Programming Languages

* Part 1 of the course will use Python. 
* All coding assignments should be coded in Python 3.10. 
* The deep learning implementation will be done in TensorFlow/Keras.

### Assignments

#### Pre-class quizzes

* Students will be required to submit a quiz on the current technology before each class. 
* The quizzes will test their understanding of the concepts discussed in the assigned pre-class videos. 
* There will be four quizzes, covering Markov Chains, Genetic Algorithms, RNN/LSTMs, and Transformers.

#### Coding Assignments

* There will be four coding assignments—one for each technique introduced in the course. 
* Coding assignments will be done in groups of two people.
* These assignments will require students to implement variations or extensions of the techniques they have learned to address a specific musical challenge (e.g., melody generation).

#### Paper Implementation

* This will involve implementing a generative music research paper from scratch, applying the concepts and skills gained throughout the course. 
* Paper implementation will be done in groups of two people.

#### Deliverables

* Link to a GitHub repository containing the implementation code. 

### Final Project

Students can choose to create a Final Project for either Part 1 or Part 2 of the course. The Final Project for Part 1 will focus on symbolic generative music, while the Final Project for Part 2 will focus on audio-based generative music.

For those opting for a Final Project in Part 1, the task will be to design and implement a symbolic generative music system. This project should demonstrate the adaptation and/or combination of one or more techniques covered during the course.

The final project can be done alone, or in a group of up to three people.

The system will generate symbolic scores, which will be sent to Ableton for sonification. The objective is to create a semi-realtime generative application with a strong focus on creative value.

The final project deliverables are: 

1. A GitHub repository link containing the implementation code.  
2. A 5-minute YouTube video presentation explaining how the model works.  
3. A 5-minute video demonstration showcasing the model in action.

### Deadlines

* The pre-class quizzes would be available as follows:  
  * Markov Chains quiz: January 12th noon \- January 13th noon  
  * Genetic Algorithms quiz: January 12th noon \- January 13th noon  
  * RNN/LSTM quiz: January 13th noon \- January 14th noon  
  * Transformer quiz: January 14th noon \- January 15th noon  
* The four code assignments are due by January 26th at midnight.  
* The paper implementation is due by January 27th at midnight.  
* The final project is due by \[insert date\] at midnight.

### Evaluation

Evaluation for the Computational Music Creativity course will be as follows:

* Part 1 (Valerio): 30% of the overall score.  
* Part 2 (Lonce): 30% of the overall score.  
* Final Project: 40% of the overall score.

#### Part 1 Evaluation

* Pre-class Quizzes (20% of Part 1 score):  
  Four quizzes, each contributing equally.  
* Coding Assignments and Paper Implementation (80% of Part 1 score):  
  These will be graded on a “pass” or “fail” basis, with each assignment contributing equally to this portion.

#### Final Project Evaluation (Part 1\)

If a student chooses to complete the Final Project associated with Part 1 (accounting for 40% of the overall course score), their work will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10 based on the following criteria:

1. Soundness of the implementation  
2. Cleanliness of the implementation (e.g., [clean code](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29))  
3. Degree of innovation in the system  
4. Clarity of the presentation  
5. Quality of the creative output
